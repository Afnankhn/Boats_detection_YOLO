# boats_detection_YOLO_model
# In this section, the demo tests conducted for boat detection on both images and videos are presented. The pretained YOLO algorithm (Version3) is used for the tesing purpose. YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection algorithm that is trained on 80 different classes of well known COCO dataset and efficiently identifies specific objects in videos or images. Figure 2 demonstrates the results on different sample images tested.
